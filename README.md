It a Random GIF generator.
In this Project I've used Axios that support Promise API
I've used this site https://developers.giphy.com/ to create GIFS 
Where first I have to create an account then I need to create an App using the API selected then on next step 
Then it will generate an API KEY, we will copy it.
This API KEY will help us to generate random Giphy.
I've also made a separate Hooks as useGif to write the common code.
